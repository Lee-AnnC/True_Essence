[Ture Essence](https://.herokuapp.com) was created by Lee-Ann Clark.
A beautiful site that takes one back to nature and its True Essence.

In today's fast paced world filled with man-made medications, there has been a shift, where people are coming back to nature and what she can provide for us.
In the way of medications for all sorts of ailments from headaches to more deeper seated problems. It is nice to be able to find a place that caters 
for all the natural ingredients from oils to soaps to ways of easings ones mind.

This is how True Essence was born.

## Design Choices
True Essence is an informative and interesting site with products from oils to candles and diffusers. 
Everything you and your home need.

The following design choices were made with this in mind:

### Colours
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/n6pz6hJ/True-Essence-Colors.png" alt=True Essence Palette aria-label=True Essence Colors </div>

- The home page is crisp in white header and with yellow lemons and green leaves.
- The navbar background is kept white all the way through, with a soft lavender as the page overlay for all other pages
- The product cards have clear white background with black writing on them which show up nicely on the lavender overlay.
- The blog posts are on a white card with an image of the category.
- The post links are done in blue so they show up nicely and can be seen straight away in the blog snippit.
- In the footer two colors were used. A soft pink and a darker purple. This makes the footer stand out more and adds contrast to the page.

### Styling
- All **buttons** on the site fit the bootstrap button styling in size and shape, I kept the colors of blue and red for the edit and delete buttons and black for the rest of the buttons. 
- Bootstrap **cards** were utilized on the products page to display the product selection.
- Bootstrap **cards** were utilized on the blog page to display the category selection, with a link to each category selection page on it. 
- hover effects
    - Some subtle **shadows** have been added to the nav bar dropdown menu's. Links have been underlined. All this gives a positive user experience.
