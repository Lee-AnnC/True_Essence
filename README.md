[Ture Essence](https://.herokuapp.com) was created by Lee-Ann Clark.
A beautiful site that takes one back to nature and its True Essence.

In today's fast paced world filled with man-made medications, there has been a shift, where people are coming back to nature and what she can provide for us.
In the way of medications for all sorts of ailments from headaches to more deeper seated problems. It is nice to be able to find a place that caters 
for all the natural ingredients from oils to soaps to ways of easings ones mind.

This is how True Essence was born.
